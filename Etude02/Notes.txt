Fixing the games

P players play a game, but only p-1 can play in any given round.
They just play p rounds with one player sitting out each around.
The results capture who came 1st, 2nd and 3rd.
The record keeper however forgot to include underscores for the player
	that sat out, so the results are collapsed.
Our aim is to take input as the results and figure out using logic,
	who sat out game -> recovering the original results and spitting them out.
	

Example with p=4:

1	2	_	3
2	_	1	3
3	2	1	_
_	2	3	1

Collapses to:
1	2	1	3
2	2	1	3
3	2	3	1


How would you recover the results?
If two players have the same score, contradiction
First result -> two players won, so either first player wins
	or third player wins
If first player wins, then analyse second result -> player 3 no
	involved in contradiction

Follow the possible results all the way down to end result,
if there is a contradiction, dismiss that game state, otherwise
add it to a list of possible original results.

Task:
	Construct all the possible results consistent with a given collapsed
		version.
	Count how many essentially different ones there are (two sets of results
		that differ only in the order that the games are played are considered
		the same)

Functions needed:
 - Check for bad format
 - Check for bad values
 - Construct 2D array of integers
 - Recursive method for generating possible outcomes
