Finding Anagrams Etude
----------------------------------------

Ignoring capitalisation, punctuation and whitespace, find anagrams of a String.

Given a dictionary and a string you're going to be asked to find the "best"
anagram for the string from words in the dictionary. The definition of "better" in 
this context:
 - Longer words used earlier are better than ones using shorter words.
 - If two anagrams start with a word of the same length, then the one where that word
 is earlier in alphabetical order is better. If they start with the same word, you compare
 first the lengths of the second word, or again by alphabetical order.
 
For given string -> 
	Scan dictionary looking for words that fit into given string, add to list of words
	For each possible combination of words ->
		Test if that combination is an anagram and if so, add to an anagram list
		Sort anagrams according to conditions provided
	Print out all anagrams of given string, or just colon and space
	

First job:
Handle input -> put all words from first group into 'candidates',
	second group into 'dictionary'

Choice of data structures:
Candidates can go into some type of list data structure, and dictionary should be
ordered as well, so maybe also a list?

Methods needed:
 - Method for finding all words in dictionary that match a given string
 - Method for finding all possible combination of words that fit within a string 
 - Method for comparing anagrams by conditions provided
 - Method for printing out all output (or print output as you go?)
