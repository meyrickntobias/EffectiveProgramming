Matplotlib is one of the most popular graphing
and data visualization libraries for Python.

In order to create a graph, use the following
steps:
    - Define the x-axis and corresponding 
    y-axis values as lists.
    - Plot them on canvas using .plot() 
    function.
    - Give a name to x-axis and y-axis using
    .xlabel() and .ylabel() functions.
    - Give a title to your plot using .title() 
    function.
    - Finally, to view your plot, we use .show() 
    function.

In order to plot another line, we can simply make
another call to .plot() with more x and y values
in the form of a Python list.

You can set the x and y axis range using plt.xlim()
and plt.ylim() functions. 

You can plot the points with a customized colour, 
different styles of lines, a customized width, 
and more.

In order to make a scatter plot, we would 
use plt.scatter(x, y, label="", color="")

plt.xlabel('x - axis')
plt.ylabel('y - axis')
plt.title('My scatter plot!')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
