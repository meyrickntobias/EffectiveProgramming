A makefile is a special file, containing shell commands, that 
you create and name makefile.
While in the directory containing this makefile, you will type make and 
the commands in the makefile will be executed. If you create more than one
makefile, be certain you are in the correct directory before typing make.
Make keeps track of the last time files were updated and only updates
those files which are required to keep the source file up to date. 
If you have a large program with many source and/or header files, when you
change a file on which others depend, you must recompile all the 
dependent files. Without a makefile, this is an extremely time-consuming
task.
