# EffectiveProgramming
This is the code I wrote for the etudes/assignments for my core University programming paper in 2021. An etude is defined as a short musical composition in the field of music, so we borrow the term for programming to mean a short programming challenge. 

The problems involved in the course were problems that required forethought and careful planning of program design. Many of the etudes required I/O processing and many of the issues relate to the real world.
